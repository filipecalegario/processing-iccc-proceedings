In this creative submission, algorithmic processes are explored as ways of establishing form in music. 
Abstract
The Creative Sketching Partner is an AI-based cocreative sketching tool that supports the conceptual design process. This AI partner presents sketches of varying visual and conceptual similarity based on the designer's sketch. The goal of the partner is to present a sketch to inspire the user to explore more of the design space and to reduce design fixation, i.e. becoming stuck on one or a class of designs during the design process. The system is meant to help designers achieve a conceptual shift during their design process by presenting similar designs or images from different domains. Users can control the parameters of the algorithm by specifying how visually and conceptually similar the system's sketch should be to their own. 
Abstract
There is an art and a craft to making an appealing fine fragrance that takes perfumers many years to master. The IBM Research AI for Product Composition system was created to assist perfumers to design novel fragrances that are appealing, well balanced and technically sound. The system has been used by Master Perfumers at Symrise to develop 2 fragrances for Brazilian millennials. This creative submission presents the two fragrances, one designed for men and the other for women. 
Abstract
Pictures of Jap Girls in Synthesis , is a machine that creates live, visual poetry (Figure 1). The machine reads, or listens to poetry in a variety of languages. It synthesizes in real-time, visual images illustrating its understanding and interpretation of the text. As an interactive installation, poets can perform live poetry, with the machine simultaneously translating it into visual imagery, allowing a synesthetic and a more universal experience (Figure 2). 
Abstract
A search journey in the imagined visions of a neural network. Given a photo, an artificial intelligence painter tries to recreate its likeness, and takes us through a visual journey in its search for the perfect reproduction. The spectator can intervene in the process, and focus on areas of her interest in the intermediate imagery. The painter will then shift its efforts to recreate the chosen impression. The emerging experience may resemble wandering within a vision or a dream. 
Abstract
Everyone eats. Many people cook. But few are aware of the unique creative challenges facing professional product developers in flavor and food product companies. The IBM Research AI for Product Composition is a system to assist product developers with these real-life creativity challenges for which no AI-solution existed. The system for compositional product development is in use at McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor. We present the first set of products targeted for retail sale that has been enabled by the system. The three seasoning mixes for one dish meals are planned to be on retail shelves mid-2019. 
Abstract
The purpose of music creation is to cause impression to listeners. Based on this way of thinking, while watching the reaction of the listener, we will describe the artificial intelligence to perform creation. In this method, based on the reaction of the listener, that is, the measurement result of the emotion, AI predicts the feeling to the new song being made. In this way, having discussed automatic composition, we discuss AI approaches to activation of a human being (brain) by songs. This system demonstrates our emotion-driven creative music composition, which composes a piece of music on the fly based on physiological sensing, such as brain waves, heart rate and skin conductance, of the user. 
Abstract
Hidden Worlds is a series of artworks created by Machine Learning exploring gender through the lens of computer vision. The works are first created by a DCGAN, then responded to by J. Rosenbaum before being reinterpreted into a generative narrative using image classifiers and tied together using Augmented Reality. This collaborative series of works is part of Rosenbaum's ongoing work with machines using 3D Modeling, machine learning and Augmented Reality. 
Abstract
In this paper we propose ChordAL, a chord-based generation system which is capable of composing melodies based on a few starting chords. It consists of 3 components: a chord generator, a chord-to-note generator, and a music styler. In our chord generator, our learnt chord embeddings surprisingly unveil the Circle of Fifths, which shows that our model is able to learn hidden musical structure through a simple chord generation task. The chord-to-note generation is treated as a seq2seq task like machine translation, and we make use of the chord embeddings learnt previously for melody generation. Evaluation results show that ChordAL performs well in generating fluent harmony due to its harmony-based nature, although its performance on rhythm and structure needs further improvement. 
Abstract
This paper furthers the study of creative design by taking a situated view of novelty. A set of computational experiments is performed utilizing an agent-based model of a design team, and resulting data is used to examine the influence of a change in a situation (or a design frame) on the perception of a design's novelty in terms of its difference from existing or possible designs. The experiments demonstrate that, over the course of designing, solutions which were regarded as novel, can become not novel. They also show that a solution which was not seen as novel in one situation can be assessed as novel when a situation changes. The results, therefore, emphasize the importance of studying novelty as a situated measure. 
Abstract
In this paper, we explore a new form of creative expression through brain controlled musical improvisation. Using EEG technology and a musical improviser system, Impro-Visor (Keller 2018), MindMusic engages users in musical improvisation sessions controlled with their brainwaves. Brain-controlled musical improvisation offers a unique blend of mindfulness meditation, EEG biofeedback, and real-time music generation, and stands to assist with stress reduction and widen access to musical creativity. 
Abstract
Semantic frames are a fundamental ingredient in computational implementations of Conceptual Blending (CB) theory. Therefore, we may ask the question of how to build them or where to retrieve them. This paper offers a solution which is to explore large-semantic networks for repeating structures resembling frames. We also include a feature the frames could have to give them a sense of completeness. Potential patterns were searched with a Multi-Objective-EvolutionaryAlgorithm (MOEA) giving wider and ampler results when compared with a Single-Objective stochastic search. 
Abstract
We propose a dynamic approach and computational artefact for the generation of cross-modal associations between the domains of visual communication and perception of emotions. This is accomplished by applying three key steps: (i) assemble an alphabet (ii), define a shape grammar, and (iii) generate computationally a dynamic representation for the previous point. We restrain the visual expression to a line movement and limit our set of emotions to four in order to establish an initial solid baseline of experiments. Experiments were done to assess the validity of the established associations between emotions and visual features. Results have confirmed some associations previously suggested by literature and have emphasized others. This approach may be a key aspect to solve problems of multi-domain contexts where non-verbal communication is required to connect two or more domains, e.g. visual arts, artistic performances, non-verbal languages, and entertainment.

Abstract
Shallow Art presents, implements, and tests the use of simple single-output classification and regression models for the purpose of art generation. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on collections of computer generated images, artworks from Vincent van Gogh, and artworks from Rembrandt van Rijn. These models are then provided half of an image and asked to complete the missing side. The resulting images are displayed, and we explore implications for computational creativity. 
Abstract
Region Radio is an artificially intelligent platform that finds and tells stories about the places that a user is moving through -- by car, bicycle, foot, or any mode of transport. Stories will typically be non-fiction with environmental and historic-cultural themes that are intended to increase a conservationist consciousness on the part of listeners and content contributors. Region Radio finds its stories on the Web, based on their relevance to places that lie on a route specified by the user; filters and ranks these stories on projected relevance; schedules these stories onto a playlist that corresponds to the route; and reads these stories as the user travels the route (to include "travel" in the minds-eye). 
Abstract
Visual blending can be employed for the visual representation of concepts, merging input representations to obtain new meanings. Yet, the question arises whether there is any need for a computational approach to visual blending. We address the topic using different points of view and conduct two user studies to assess the usefulness of a visual blending system. 
Abstract
This paper introduces experimental research in progress concerning a novel creative software construction method that uses the Engagement-Reflection model and Floyd-Hoare logic. By considering software construction as a creative writing task, we demonstrate how principles from story generation can be applied in software construction. 
Abstract
In many instances, computationally creative systems need to meaningful interact with human agents--by existing in the environment they live in and/or interfacing with one or more forms of humans perception and/or understanding the way that humans structure their perceptions of the environment. In this preliminary work, we present a model of a mind's knowledge base consisting of concepts that are grounded in sensory perception of environmental phenomena. Although the individual components of this model are complex and difficult to fully define, our model's structure describes how knowledge is acquired and used for expression--including creative expression--and aesthetic assessment. Our formalization aims to serve as an abstract modularization that effectively factorizes these complex operations.

Abstract
The quality of outputs produced by deep generative models for music have seen a dramatic improvement in the last few years. However, most deep learning models perform in "offline" mode, with few restrictions on the processing time. Integrating these types of models into a live structured performance poses a challenge because of the necessity to respect the beat and harmony. Further, these deep models tend to be agnostic to the style of a performer, which often renders them impractical for live performance. In this paper we propose a system which enables the integration of out-of-the-box generative models by leveraging the musician's creativity and expertise.

Abstract
Creative self-expression is considered as central to any artistic activity. It is governed by an inherent need in a person to express the self through a creative or an artistic medium, e.g., visual art, poetry, music, drama, design, etc. In this paper, we explore and provide a classification of the notion of self from the various perspectives of philosophy, psychology, modern science, etc. This is done with a view to understand the self holistically and to frame a definition in the context of `creative selfexpression'. We also aim to initiate a discussion on the relevance of the concept of self to the field of computational creativity. 
Abstract
We present Churnalist, a headline generator for creating contextually-appropriate fictional headlines that can be used as `flavor text' in games. Churnalist creates new headlines from existing headlines with text modification. It extracts seed words from free text input, queries a knowledge base for related words and uses these words in the new headlines. Churnalist's knowledge base consists of a dataset of pre-trained word embeddings, thus requiring no linguistic expertise or hand-coded models from the user. 
Abstract
One of the defining characteristics of human creativity is the ability to make conceptual leaps, creating something surprising from existing knowledge. In comparison, deep neural networks often struggle to handle cases outside of their training data, which is especially problematic for problems with limited training data. Approaches exist to transfer knowledge from models trained on one problem with sufficient data to new problems with insufficient data, but they tend to require additional training or a domain-specific method of transfer. We present conceptual expansion, a general approach for reusing existing trained models to derive new models without backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on few-shot variations of two tasks: image classification and image generation, and outperform standard transfer learning approaches. 
Abstract
This paper presents work on modelling the social psychological aspect of socialization in the case of a computationally creative master-apprentice system. In each master-apprentice pair, the master, a genetic algorithm, is seen as a parent for its apprentice, which is an NMT based sequence-to-sequence model. The effect of different parenting styles on the creative output of each pair is in the focus of this study. This approach brings a novel view point to computational social creativity, which has mainly focused in the past on computationally creative agents being on a socially equal level, whereas our approach studies the phenomenon in the context of a social hierarchy. 
Abstract
Many computer systems are becoming increasingly tailored to their users, customizing and optimizing their experience. However, most conversational agents do not follow this trend when it comes to humorous interactions. Instead, they employ pre-written answers regardless of whether the user liked previous similar interactions. While there already exist several computational humor systems that can successfully generate jokes, their joke generation models, parameters or even both are often fixed. In this paper, we propose G OOFER, a general framework for computational humor that learns joke structures and parameterizations from rated example jokes. This framework uses metrical schemas, a new notion we introduce, which are a generalization of several types of other schemas. This new type of schema makes regular schemas compatible with machine learning techniques. We also propose a strategy for identifying useful humor metrics based on humor theory, which can be used as features for the machine learning algorithm. The G OOFER framework uses these novel concepts to construct a pipeline with new components around previous generators. Using a mapping to our previous work on analogy jokes, we show that this framework cannot only generate this type of jokes well, but also find the importance of specific humor metrics for template values. This indicates that it is on the right track towards joke generation systems that can automatically learn new templates and schemas from rated examples. This work thus forms a stepping stone towards creating programs with a sense of humor that is adaptable to the user. 
Abstract
Design and analysis of creative agent societies is often done in the context of computational sociology, which has evolved into its own field called computational social creativity (Saunders and Bown 2015). In this paper, we propose a formal framework for describing and analysing creative agent societies based on the Creative Systems Framework (CSF) (Wiggins 2006a; 2006b). We extend the CSF for single agents to include creative agent societies. The extended CSF allows us to describe society wide phenomena relevant for creativity, identify how individual agents relate to the whole society and characterise societal consequences caused by adopting certain policies. All these formal tools may be used when analysing designated creative agent societies. We demonstrate this by devising a straightforward practical procedure which may be used to gain insight into the influence individual agents have on the society over time. 
Abstract
Art analysis is a key aspect for computational systems whose goal is to generate visual artifacts. This paper proposes a six steps methodology to analyze and represent design principles from art works. Our approach starts with an image segmentation followed by the construction of a straight skeleton. Then we extract some color information and perform shape analysis and classification. Finally some design principles are calculated and groups of elements are built over a complete graph. Our internal art work representation gives us a way to approximate the phases of artistic appreciation proposed by some authors. We show a procedure to generalize compositional rules for the generation of new abstract art works based on the steps of the proposed methodology. We plan to use a self organizing map to cluster our art work representations and use this information to build a hypergraph and/or multigraph. Since these graphs can represent design principles, the system will be able to use these structures to explore new ways to generate artifacts and measure their novelty compared to previous exemplars. 
Abstract
INES (Interactive Narrative Emotional Storyteller) is a story generation system based on the Afanasyev framework. It is focused on generating stories by combining template-based plot generation with an agent-based simulation of characters' interaction. Its design follows the microservice-oriented model established by Afanasyev, in which a Story Director orchestrates the story generation stages, implemented by specialised microservices. While this model is suitable for generating a single plot story, it is insufficient for managing a multiple plots scenario. This paper focuses on describing an evolved version of INES that aims at generating stories that contain different plot lines. In addition to the adoption of changes in the story representation model, the adaptation entails a modification of the operation of INES and includes a new microservice: the Plot Weaver. This component introduces the application of a literary technique referred to as the "Communicating Vessels", in which the different lines evolve in parallel while interacting between themselves. 
Abstract
A common aspect to creativity as described by creative theorists is the juxtaposition and balance of two opposing qualities, namely novelty and typicality. Practical models of computational creativity are needed that effectively leverage the contributions of each of these qualities in a synchronous manner. We discuss the effectiveness of constrained probabilistic models in representing this duality in generative models of creativity. We illustrate constrained Markov models as an example of a constrained probabilistic model and demonstrate its application to computational creativity in the elaboration of a system called NhMMonic for generating mnemonic devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system1 using a qualitative survey. Our findings suggest that the constrained Markov model is particularly effective at generating mnemonics that exhibit novelty and typicality in grammatical and semantic flow with the overall result of more effective mnemonics for the purpose of memorization. Source code as well as our mnemonic device generator are both freely accessible online. 
Abstract
Inpainting-based generative modeling allows for stimulating human-machine interactions by letting users perform stylistically coherent local editions to an object using a statistical model. We present NONOTO, a new interface for interactive music generation based on inpainting models. It is aimed both at researchers, by offering a simple and flexible API allowing them to connect their own models with the interface, and at musicians by providing industry-standard features such as audio playback, real-time MIDI output and straightforward synchronization with DAWs using Ableton Link. 
Abstract
News headlines are the main method for briefly providing a summary of the news article and attracting an audience. In this paper, we experiment with different existing methods for producing colourful expressions and news headlines computationally, in a practical setting. Our case study is conducted by modifying an automated journalism system that generates multilingual news in three languages, namely English, Finnish and Swedish. We adapt existing methods for creative headlines and figurative language generation into the headline generation process of the system, modifying them to work in a multilingual setting. We conduct our evaluation by asking online judges to assess the original titles produced by the unmodified system and those enhanced by the methods described in this paper. The results of the evaluation suggest that the presented methods increase the creativity of existing headlines while maintaining their descriptiveness. 
Abstract
We introduce a new spreadsheet based interface called SpaceSheets for creating novel images and other media. Unlike traditional digital tools, ours is parameterized entirely by a neural network with no preprogrammed rules or knowledge representations. The capability of SpaceSheets to support visual exploration and communication is demonstrated within the context of several domains including facial images, fonts, and english words. SpaceSheets is demonstrated to support the experimentation and exploration of latent spaces enabling more effective design experimentation. 
Abstract
In this work, we introduce a system for real-time generation of drum sounds. This system is composed of two parts: a generative model for drum sounds together with a Max4Live plugin providing intuitive controls on the generative process. The generative model consists of a Conditional Wasserstein autoencoder (CWAE), which learns to generate Mel-scaled magnitude spectrograms of short percussion samples, coupled with a Multi-Head Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) which estimates the corresponding audio signal from the magnitude spectrogram. The design of this model makes it lightweight, so that it allows one to perform real-time generation of novel drum sounds on an average CPU, removing the need for the users to possess dedicated hardware in order to use this system. We then present our Max4Live interface designed to interact with this generative model. With this setup, the system can be easily integrated into a studio-production environment and enhance the creative process. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our system and how the interaction of music producers with such tools could change the way drum tracks are composed. 
Abstract
The ability to generate surprising outputs is essential for creative behavior. Surprise, or violation of expectation, has been hypothesized to be part of a fundamental mechanism enabling the capacity for emotion found in creative fields such as music, art, humor, or literature. Machine learning approaches to music generation train one model and sample from its distribution to generate new outputs. We show that this one-model sampling is fundamentally limited in its capacity for surprise. Drawing on insights from music and humor understanding, we propose a two-model architecture composed of an audience model for learning expectations connected to a composer model for learning to surprise. The new architecture facilitates a natural measure for surprise that is used in experimental evaluations on a set of synthetic tasks with binary strings. When instantiated with neural networks, the composer-audience model is shown to successfully learn to generate deterministic or random patterns of surprise, demonstrating its potential as a general framework for machine learning approaches to creative processes. 
Abstract
This paper focuses on the use of using appropriate parametric modelling approaches for computational design optimization in architecture. In many cases, architects do not apply appropriate parametric modelling approaches to describe their design concepts, and as a result, the design search space defined by the parametric model can be problematic. This can further make it difficult for the computational optimization process to produce optimized designs. As a result, the design search space needs to be reshaped in order to allow the computational design optimization process to fully exploit the potential of the design concept on improving the design quality. In this paper, we identify two common types of inappropriate modelling approaches. The first one is related to the design search space that lacks proper constraints, and the second is related to the design search space fixed by the conventional design knowledge. Two case studies are presented to exemplify these two types of inappropriate parametric modelling approaches and demonstrate how these approaches can undermine the utility of computational design optimization. 
Abstract
Numerous scientific disciplines, e.g. social sciences, benefit from field work. What does field work look like in Computational Creativity and what are its potential benefits to research? We refer to the effort of actively making a system or its artifacts widely accessible outside the academia world, and as such getting feedback, as `field work'. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences taking our systems, Alysia and MEXICA, out into the wild terrain by making them broadly available. In the case of Alysia, the system itself was made accessible; MEXICA's artifacts (stories) were shared through a traditionally published book for a broad readership. We consider the utility of field work for these vastly different systems on the CC continuum (P´ erez y P´ erez 2018), and discuss potential benefits to other research in the area. Finally, we discuss the necessity of developing methodology to enable rigorous registration of knowledge arising from field work in Computational Creativity. 
Abstract
This paper concerns the development of a music cocreation system that engenders creative partnerships in musical interaction. Towards this goal, specific design guidelines are identified for improving the musicians' sense of creative partnership with the system through behaviors that communicate musical intent, alternate musical roles based on musical stability, and negotiate transitions in musical characteristics based on togetherness in interaction. The design guidelines motivate the development of an agent architecture for interactive improvisation. The architecture enables an agent to select music response behaviors based on the stability and togetherness sensed during interaction. An agent improvisation system is developed that uses the architecture to make decisions during improvised percussion duets. The agent negotiates transitions between musical roles and musical characteristics by maintaining different degrees of metrical coherence and similarity with the rhythms played by the musician. By negotiating transitions with a musician, the system presumably has an impact on the musicians sense of creative musical partnership. 
Abstract
We describe the HR3 system for automated code generation, and its use in creative tasks. We outline the motivations and overall ideology behind its construction, most notably by identifying some distinctions in AI methodology which can be ignored when AI tasks are viewed as code generation problems to be solved. We further describe the nature of the approach in terms of: a programmatic interface to a Java API; production rule-based batch processing of data; on-demand code generation and inspection, and the usage of randomised and meta-level codebases. To support the claim that the approach is general purpose, we describe five applications in three areas normally covered by separate Computational Creativity systems, namely mathematical discovery, datamining and generative art. We end by discussing future directions for the HR3 system and how this project might address some higher-level issues in Computational Creativity. 
Abstract
The notion of framing computationally created artefacts - by providing a narrative context for the actions and motivations of the software - is an important part of building computationally creative software. In this paper we provide the first survey of framing in computational creativity; we provide a taxonomy of framing elements, covering motivation, implementation and rendering; and we look at future directions for framing, as well as its importance for the field's future. 
Abstract
Prior work investigating student perceptions of scientists has revealed commonly-held beliefs, stereotypes, and even connections to career choices. We adapt the "Draw-A-Scientist" instrument to examine how undergraduates depict computational creativity researchers and the field of computational creativity as a whole. Our results indicate that there are significant differences when students are asked to draw or describe a computer scientist versus a computational creativity researcher. Whether the student is an upper-level or introductory computer science student appears to also influence responses. 
Abstract
Framing, the accompanying information that sometimes comes provided with a work of art in order to explain the artist's intention, the creation process or to present the artwork in a special light, has been theorized to improve the appearance of creativity of the generating act (Charnley, Pease, and Colton 2012). One type of highly regarded framing in the literary domain is the critique, an interpretative work which provides a functional, thematic and/or symptomatic condensation of the essence of the primary text, basically, a summary. The present paper empirically tests whether computationally generated narratives can, too, be framed through functional summaries, and whether this framing indeed contributes to the system's perceived creativity. To do so, it employs the functional unit (FU) summary approach conceived--but never fully implemented--by Lehnert (1981), in order to summarize a story generated by a storytelling algorithm. It compares the performance of FU summary with other approaches, and based on this data evaluates whether better summaries can also serve as better framings, as well as whether better framings increase a system's perceived creativity. Our results indicate that (1) FU based summary performs around human level, (2) better summaries are indeed judged to be better framings, but that (3) neither of these two factors have a significant effect on perceived creativity. Based on this we conclude that further scrutiny and empirical study is required to understand how framing can be harnessed for computational creativity. 
Abstract
This paper presents a computational model for conceptual shifts, based on a novelty metric applied to a vector representation generated through deep learning. This model is integrated into a co-creative design system, which enables a partnership between an AI agent and a human designer interacting through a sketching canvas. The AI agent responds to the human designer's sketch with a new sketch that is a conceptual shift: intentionally varying the visual and conceptual similarity with increasingly more novelty. The paper presents the results of a user study showing that increasing novelty in the AI contribution is associated with higher creative outcomes, whereas low novelty leads to less creative outcomes. 
Abstract
The generative capabilities of deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been attracting increasing attention for both the remarkable artifacts they produce, but also because of the vast conceptual difference between how they are programmed and what they do. DNNs are "black boxes" where high-level behavior is not explicitly programed, but emerges from the complex interactions of thousands or millions of simple computational elements. Their behavior is often described in anthropomorphic terms that can be misleading, seem magical, or stoke fears of an imminent singularity in which machines become "more" than human. In this paper, we examine 5 distinct behavioral characteristics associated with creativity, and provide an example of a mechanisms from generative deep learning architectures that give rise to each these characteristics. All 5 emerge from machinery built for purposes other than the creative characteristics they exhibit, mostly classification. These mechanisms of creative generative capabilities thus demonstrate a deep kinship to computational perceptual processes. By understanding how these different behaviors arise, we hope to on one hand take the magic out of anthropomorphic descriptions, but on the other, to build a deeper appreciation of machinic forms of creativity on their own terms that will allow us to nurture their further development. 
Abstract
Philosopher Cameron Buckner's (2018) study of deep convolutional networks (DCNN) mechanisms produced a notion of "transformation abstraction." The layers, convolutions, and pooling mechanisms of DCNNs "jointly implement a form of hierarchical abstraction that reduces the complexity of a problem's feature space (and avoids overfitting the network's training samples) by iteratively transforming it into a simplified representational format that preserves and accentuates task-relevant features while controlling for nuisance variation." That is, classification in DNNs is identified with a process of abstraction. In the realm of art, there are at least two types of images we call "abstract." One is comprised of shapes, lines, and colors that are not readily identifiable as any real-world object. Examples include the cube and line "neoplastic" paintings of Mondrian. A second kind of abstract image is comprised of some features that form the basis for an identification as a real-world object, but includes others that are generally not associated with the real world object, and lacks many that are. Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2 can be considered of this type. Tom White's Perception Engine (2018 a, b) foregrounds the notion of abstraction as well as the role of perception in the generative process. One component of the Engine is an image generator constrained to generate combinations of curved lines and blobs. The other is a pre-trained classification network trained on many thousands of example images, each belonging to one of a large collection of labeled categories (e.g. electric fan, golf cart, basketball). The generator starts with a random combination of the shapes it is constrained to draw, and iteratively manipulates the image to increase the strength of a specific category in a classification network. Figure 7 shows an image generated to maximize the "hammerhead shark" category. 
Abstract
We propose a deep learning algorithm that can detect content and discover co-occurring patterns of the content in fine art paintings. The following intellectual merits are the motivations of our project. First, the content detection provides a baseline of Computational Iconography (CI), which is to understand what objects/subjects can be seen in fine art paintings. Second, we argue that the found co-occurring patterns chart meaningful connectivity across content in art. Third, we imbed our system in Computational Creativity (CC) in a broad sense. By the nature of our system of machine learning, it creates informative connections between different modalities (images/words), which are not initially constructed or intentionally specified. Our system is automatically trained to discover the connective patterns reflecting artists' creativity, which are latent in the large dataset of paintings. To build a content detector, we adopted an InceptionV3 (ImageNet) and fine-tuned it over 40,000 paintings with the words extracted from their titles. We validate that our system detects content information fairly (68% precision rate at the top content). Also, we find that the last fully connected layer parameters of InceptionV3 are trained to encode general co-occurring patterns between content. We validate that the co-occurrence can be interpreted as relatedness among content in art. 
Abstract
Most of the currently existing narrative generation systems do not consider the task of adding dialogues to enrich the interactions between characters. An important factor to take into account when two characters speak are the emotions they feel and the ones they perceive from the character they are talking to. In this work we present Emolift, an automatic dialogue generation system of short elevator dialogues where emotions are the driving force to build dialogues. We have implemented a system capable of creating dialogues based on the emotions of the characters and the perception of other character's emotions in order to nourish and enrich storytelling systems. 
Abstract
Science and mathematics are currently underrepresented in the computational creativity (CC) community. We discuss why the CC community should apply their work to mathematical and scientific domains, and argue that this would be mutually beneficial for the domains in question. We identify a key challenge in Automated Reasoning ­ that it has not achieved widespread adoption by mathematicians; and one in Automated Scientific Discovery ­ the need for communicability of automatically generated scientific knowledge. We recommend that CC researchers help to address these two challenges by: (i) applying systems based on cognitive mechanisms to scientific and mathematical domains; (ii) employing experience in building and evaluating interactive systems to this context; and (iii) using expertise in automatically producing framing functionality to enhance the communicability of automatically generated scientific knowledge. 
Abstract
Research on narrative generation needs to consider that a run-of-the-mill would-be novelist is usually much more concerned with getting the form of his output right than with finding new techniques or new materials. Resorting to prior techniques and materials is considered an acceptable practice, and rewrites of classic stories, sequels or series of novels set in an already described world are highly valued. In this light the need to produce outputs that are recognisable as instances of stories seems to have priority over other criteria for a narrative generation solution. The present paper follows accepted engineering practice in choosing this particular challenge as starting design goal for an initial module, to be later extended with solutions for selecting or achieving "good" or "novel" stories at a later stage. The paper proposes a representation of plot that captures both a surface structure in terms of adjacency in a discourse sequence and conceptual connections between elements of the plot that may span across its length. Based on this representation, a solution is proposed for plot generation that produces a broad range of outputs that are acceptable as instances of stories. 
Abstract
An approach to make text visually appealing and memorable is semantic reinforcement ­ the use of visual cues alluding to the context or theme in which the word is being used to reinforce the message (e.g., Google Doodles). We present a computational approach for semantic reinforcement called TReAT ­ Thematic Reinforcement for Artistic Typography. Given an input word (e.g. exam) and a theme (e.g. education), the individual letters of the input word are replaced by cliparts relevant to the theme which visually resemble the letters ­ adding creative context to the otherwise ordinary and uninspiring input word. We use an unsupervised approach to learn a latent space to represent letters and cliparts and compute similarities between the two. Human studies show that participants can reliably recognize the word as well as the theme in our outputs (TReATs) and find them more creative compared to meaningful baselines. 
Abstract
If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then creativity can be sought in computational commentators on arts and artifacts across diverse form and media. While most research in computational creativity focuses on the generative nature of creativity, we address how interpretative aspects of creativity can be manifest by and implemented in computational agents as well. 
Abstract
The classical arts of rhetoric described intricate training methodologies for making the writer linguistically flexible and able to avoid stylistic vices. Inspired by the ancient progymnasmata, this paper presents Progym, an interactive writing system designed to notice when writers resort to expected language and encourage them to avoid these linguistic elements. Two versions of the system are presented. The first discourages writers from using words that, within a large corpus, are often used to describe a target word. The second discourages writers from using syntactic patterns found in a small corpus. In user studies, Progym did indeed push writers away from these features, though the different versions led to different styles of revision. 
Abstract
Our team of dance artists, physicists, and machine learning researchers has collectively developed several original, configurable machine-learning tools to generate novel sequences of choreography as well as tunable variations on input choreographic sequences. We use recurrent neural network and autoencoder architectures from a training dataset of movements captured as 53 three-dimensional points at each timestep.

This paper describes DeepIMAGINATION, a neural architecture to generate variants of movement-based object interactions with props using the physical attributes of props while playing the Props game. The agent can generate these action variants while searching a learned action space in real-time to provide improvised responses to its human partner. Convolutional and recurrent variants of CVAEs are used for experimentation. The paper presents an evaluation of the architecture by benchmarking its ability to learn the human data set and generate believable, recognizable, and high-quality action variants from it. Results showed that the agent could generate believable, high-quality action variants. but that recognizability requires improvement. 
Abstract
Performance RNN is a machine-learning system designed primarily for the generation of solo piano performances using an event-based (rather than audio) representation. More specifically, Performance RNN is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network that models polyphonic music with expressive timing and dynamics (Oore et al., 2018). The neural network uses a simple language model based on the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) file format. Performance RNN is trained on the e-Piano Junior Competition Dataset (International Piano e-Competition, 2018), a collection of solo piano performances by expert pianists. As an artistic tool, one of the limitations of the original model has been the lack of useable controls. The standard form of Performance RNN can generate interesting pieces, but little control is provided over what specifically is generated. This paper explores a set of conditioning-based controls used to influence the generation process. 
Abstract
The objective of this study is to design a general computational model of story creativity as the fundamental component of a cognitive system. In this paper, a theoretical framework for computational story blending is presented. This framework is inspired by cognitive and computational models of conceptual blending. Story blending, which is defined as composing a novel story by combining two input stories, is a fundamental principle of story creativity. Although the idea proposed in this paper has not been implemented yet, this study provides a theoretical basis for a computational modeling of story blending.

Abstract
We humans often compensate for our own weaknesses by partnering with those with complementary strengths. So fiction is full of characters who complete each other, just as show-business thrives on successful double acts. If it works for humans, then why not for our machines? The comparative strengths and weaknesses of different CC systems are well-documented in the literature, just as the pros & cons of various technologies or platforms are well known to the builders of these systems. A good pairing does more than compensate for the weaknesses of one with the strengths of another: it can find value in disparity, and deliver results that are beyond the reach of either partner alone. Here we consider the pairing of two CC systems in the same thematic area, a speechbased story-teller (with Alexa) and an embodied storyteller (using a NAO robot). Working together, these two compensate for each other's weaknesses while creating something of comedic value that neither has on its own. 
Abstract
Context is crucial to creativity, as shown by the significance we attach to the labels P- and H-Creativity. It is context that allows a system to truly assess novelty, or to ensure that its topical artifacts really are topical. An important but an often overlooked aspect of context is personality. A CC system that is designed to reflect a specific aspect of the creative temperament, whether it is humour, arrogance or whimsy, must stay true to this assumed personality in its actions. Likewise, a system that creates artifacts that are rooted in emotion must be sensitive to the personality or mood of its audience. But here we must tread carefully, as the assessment of personal qualities often implies judgement, and so few of us like to be judged, especially by our machines. To better understand the upsides and pitfalls of topicalityand personality-based CC systems, we unpack three of these systems here, and explore the lessons they offer. 
Abstract
We present TwitSong 3.0, a found poetry system which locates candidate lines in a source text or generates them, then edits the lines repeatedly to increase their score on measures of meter, topicality, imagery, and emotion. We evaluate TwitSong 3.0 using a survey of domain experts. The system's editing process does significantly improve its lines, although the resulting poems are not always coherent, and the experimental evidence suggests that the improvement may not occur through the precise mechanisms we intended.
